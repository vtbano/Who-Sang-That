          Do you ever have that moment where you hear a tune and you just can't
          recall <strong>Who Sang That?</strong>? This game does just that, but
          eliminates those helpful hints like the voice, the beat, and the
          sound. You have 10 rounds that display the lytics and 3 different
          artists to choose from as the perfect pair.
          <strong
            >Are you up to this 10 round challenge that tests you top hits
            knowledge?
